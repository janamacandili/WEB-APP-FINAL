            <h2>HISTORY</h2>
            <p>
                Established in March 2025, Groove Boulevard was primarily created with the clear objective of supporting the
                local music scene by providing essential instruments and performance gear for aspiring artists and bands,
                particularly in urban communities across Southern Luzon and Central Visayas. As the passion for music among
                the youth and grassroots creatives grew, so did the demand for accessible, affordable, and trustworthy sources
                of musical instruments and services. In response, Groove Boulevard expanded its vision—offering a complete
                line of instruments, sound equipment, and creative support to musicians of all levels. Through this initiative,
                Groove Boulevard became a growing force in promoting musical expression and community-driven creativity.
            </p>
            <p>
                In April 2025, Groove Boulevard launched its first experience center in Nuvali, Laguna with only 10 dedicated
                individuals—six customer care staff and four operations personnel. The space featured a curated showroom of
                musical instruments, a collaborative jamming zone, and a series of beginner-friendly workshops and open mic
                nights. Due to overwhelming support and increasing demand, Groove Boulevard opened its second branch in
                Cebu City by the end of the same year.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, Groove Boulevard continues to thrive—employing over 80 team members, collaborating with over 40
                independent artists and music groups, and managing 10 retail and performance hubs across the Philippines.
                The brand has also expanded its catalog to include international and homegrown instrument brands, music
                production tools, and community engagement programs. Groove Boulevard's success is driven by its inclusive
                leadership, consistent product quality, passionate staff, and unyielding support for Filipino music culture. With
                eyes on the future, Groove Boulevard remains committed to uplifting the next generation of music creators and
                audiences nationwide.
